# Sass Gradle Compiler :zap:

A simple Sass compiler for gradle (tested only on Gradle 6.0+). Given a folder containing .sass and .css files, the plugin will compile them into a single file. 

## Instructions :pencil:

As stated before the plugin was tested and developed with gradle 6 so I cannot ensure functionality with older versions.

Work in progress

## Built With :hammer:

* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - Dependency Management
* [jsass](https://jsass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Used to compile sass
